                        Welcome to my vlog! My name is Miguel and I'm a climber based in Orange County, CA.
                        I started climbing in 2014 and was hooked ever since.
                        I boulder, sport climb, and gym climb currently and hopefully someday will get into trad and big wall climbing as well.
                        I started this vlog to share the adventures I have gone on and my climbing experiences with anyone who would like to watch and hopefully get some motivation from.
                        Feel free to comment, question, or reach out to me!
